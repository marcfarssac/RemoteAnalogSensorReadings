Remote analog sensor reading with mobile Android App realtime monitoring
================

This repository is part of the end-to-end project gathering remote sensor data, pushing it to the cloud and displaying it in real time in a remote Android App (as explained in the Youtube video below). 

The code in this repository is the Gateway gathers Analog values through the AC1 and AC2 and pushes their digital equivalent to the Cloud. The App has also settings so that values are only sent to the Cloud after a certain time or when a threshold has been surpased.
